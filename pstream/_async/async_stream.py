    """The API for an AsyncStream has a 1:1 correspondence with the API for a :class:`Stream` (with the exception of

    The difference is that an AsyncStream may accept asynchronous iterators (objects for which `__anext__` is defined)
    and asynchronous functions at all opportunities.

    However, it is not `mandatory` that the provided iterators and functions are asynchronous. Synchronous iterators
    will be wrapped into an asynchronous adaptor and synchronous functions will be called as normal with no additional
    overhead.

        >>> got = await AsyncStream().repeat(1).take(5).collect()
        >>> assert got == [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

        A call to `repeat` wipes out any previous step in the iterator.

        :Example:
        >>> # The initial range, enumeration, and chain are completely lost
        >>> # and the stream returns 1 indefinitely.
        >>> s = await AsyncStream(range(10)).enumerate().chain(range(10, 20)).repeat(1)

        Unless a limiting step, such as :meth:`AsyncStream.take_while` or :meth:`AsyncStream.take`, has been setup after
        a call to `repeat`, the consumers :meth:`AsyncStream.collect` and :meth:`AsyncStream.count`
        will throw an :class:`errors.InfiniteCollectionError`.

        :Example:
        >>> try:
        ...     await AsyncStream().repeat(1).collect()
        ... except InfiniteCollectionError as error:
        ...     print(error)
        AsyncStream.collect was called on an infinitely repeating iterator. If you use Stream.repeat, then you MUST include either a Stream.take or a Stream.take_while if you wish to call Stream.collect
